"""Red/blue image distinction through ATOMesh: one text, sent with a red
image, then a blue one, then the red one again, one request after the other,
with the engine's prefix cache on (checks/distinct.env).

Passes when each answer names its own color and not the other, ATOMesh's log
($RUN_DIR/mesh.log) holds one routing decision event per request, the red
and blue ones with different key hashes, and the second red request starts
its prefill further into the engine's prefix cache than the blue one did
(its first prefill batch's "done" cursor in $RUN_DIR/atom.log). With the
text shared, only the images' media digests can tell the two routing keys
apart, and only the images' cache_seed keeps the blue request off the red
one's cached KV; the second red request shows that KV was there to reuse.
